## What is AstroOS?
AstroOS is an open-source project that enhances Windows. Optimizations include enhanced privacy, usability, performance, and changes for minimal stutters.

## Why AstroOS?
### Privacy
AstroOS removes the majority of telemetry embedded within Windows and implements numerous group policies to minimize data collection.

### Performance
AstroOS implements numerous meaningful changes to improve Windows performance and responsiveness without breaking essential features.

### Security
AstroOS doesn't turn off security features such as Windows Defender and Windows Update.

### Usability
AstroOS applies many modifications and default settings to make Windows easier to use.

### Open source

Unlike custom Windows ISOs, AstroOS is more straightforward to audit due to the use of [AME Wizard](https://ameliorated.io). AME Wizard is controlled by Playbooks, a customizable script-esque system that can perform various tasks.
