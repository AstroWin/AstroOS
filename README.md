## What is AstroOS?
AstroOS is an open-source OS, that fixes most of the problems with Windows.

## Why you should choose AstroOS?
### Privacy
AstroOS removes most of the telemetry in Windows. 

### Performance
AstroOS enhances performance by removing bloat, optimizing your Windows settings and much more.

### Security
AstroOS doesn't remove security features like Windows Defender and Windows Update.

### Open source
Unlike some Windows mods that use Custom ISOs, AstroOS uses playbooks. This makes AstroOS much better and fully open-source!
